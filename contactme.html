        <h2>About me:</h2>
        <p>My name is Pedro Maria Paraíso, I am a portuguese student and I’m applaying to your Computer Science Program.
Since 2010 I knew what I wanted to do in university, because my passion for computers and the internet has been very strong since then, so I knew that computer science was the right course to follow for my future.
My desire of being part of other cultures and diferent ways of living has been with me since I was young. For the last 5 years I lived in Brazil to follow my dream, study abroad, I knew that from Brazil would be easier to go to USA. However, this option wasn’t financially viable, so I had to look for other alternatives. That’s how I heard about a company who sents portuguese studentes to UK, and now I rekindle the hope of living my dream.
After analysing several options,I chose your university because Coventry gives the best answers to what I’m looking for in different ways: in addition to considering your program the best in what I want, the environment, spirit of community and hospitality of the city seem to me factors wich will contribute positively to my integration in this new experience of living in the UK.
For you to get to know me a litle better, I think it’s important to talk about my journey beyond my school activities, because I think that these enrich me on the level of character and personality, features wich also take part when talking about the opportunity to change my lifestyle, to one that needs autonomy and the ability to manage my day-to-day life by myself.
Since I was a child I played handball, football and tennis. I know that being involved in sports helps with concentration and sense of responsibility towards fellow colleagues and professors, so I know the importance of respect for others and my surrounding space.
I also participate and won the Robcup 2014 Super Team with my portuguese friends and school, wich gave me a good sense of teamwork, in addition to reinforcing my interest in the area of computer sciense and technology.
I really believe that joining Coventry University will help me a lot by being very good in the educational part and even better in the social part, wich I think is the key to have a successful career, wich is my main goal.</p><p>Thank you very much for your consideration.</p>
